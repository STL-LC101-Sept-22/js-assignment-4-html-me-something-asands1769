         <h2 class="headers"><center>The Transition</center></h2>
         <p>After 11 years in the industry, cooking overseas, a culinary degree &amp; countless 60 hour weeks working on my feet, I quickly realized my culinary career was coming to a close.  Cooking was my first love, but after sustaining back problems at the age of only 29, not being able to see my spouse for more than a couple hours week after week, &amp; quickly realizing I wasn't making enough to keep up with the cost of living, I finally made the decision to step away from the industry.  It wasn't easy, after spending such a long time mastering something, I spent 3 years alone mastering sushi &amp; another year in Ireland cooking for a hotel there.  I remember spending days slicing Nigiris, fabricating fish, practicing rolls, cooking at 5 am.  Just like coding, it was a journey. From learning mother sauces, different cuisines &amp; cultures, &amp; not seeing the sunlight for days a time working so many hours, it's finally time to put it behind me &amp; focus on my new career.  Where did this come from?  Well, that's an easy one.  I took two electives in highschool, Culinary Arts &amp; C++.  Though I don't remember it much today, I remember how much I enjoyed it, &amp; exceled at it.  The only issue was getting my feet in the water, as I was too afraid of drowning, but not anymore.</p>

         <article id="articles">Working as a Sushi Sous chef, I achieved the 'Itamae' title in my work place.  I led the kitchen, restructured our work day for efficiency, &amp; learned every aspect of the role.  From pH rice tests, to super freezing &amp; washing frozen tuna, to the best cutting techniques, I mastered everything &amp; became the main sushi leader in the kitchen after multiple years of practice.  This was one of my biggest achievements in the food service industry. </article>

         <h3 class="headers"><center>The Journey Begins with a Launch</center></h3>
         <p>I  knew roughly what LaunchCode was passing by the building a couple times, but a friend I've known since Highschool told me she was taking it.  Like many others, she raved about it, &amp; is definitely one of LaunchCodes many success stories.  After my latest doctor's appointment I had finally made up my mind, it's time to transition &amp; her mentioning this course could not have been more perfect timing.  With the help of my spouse, &amp; years of saving, I was able to switch to part-time &amp; able to focus hard on this course.  My spouse is from Argentina, &amp; when they first came into the country they were not able to work, so during that time I supported us &amp; paid for their schooling.  Now, they want to return the favor, which much success in their field they are helping support me while I focus on this journey &amp; transition.  All things are falling into place, now the only thing left is to put in the work.  Still feeling imposter syndrome frequently, like I'll never truly get to leave the industry, &amp; how I don't belong here, I've been able to work through these feelings &amp; begin what I feel will be my successful journey with LaunchCode. </p>

         <h4 class="headers"><center>Hard Work &amp; Dedication</center></h4>
         <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">The biggest advantage I have here is knowing what a 16 hour day feels like, on your feet the entire time.  Anytime I need motivation, I remember what was like, &amp; refuse to take this opportunity that was presented to me for granted.  This is just the beginning of what will be a long, difficult journey for me, but with the resources provided to me, &amp; the support of my TAs, fellow classmates, spouse, &amp; others who support me from afar, I know I will get through this.  Working with my brain instead of my body is a different kind of work for sure, but with everyone &amp; everything behind me during this, I am learning &amp; transitioning into it well.  While the road is still long ahead, this is the most excited I've been about my future in nearly 10 years, &amp; I have LaunchCode to thank for it.  Thank you!</p>
